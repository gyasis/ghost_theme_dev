# ghost_theme_dev

## Overview

Just a simple Docker environment setup for Ghost theme developement

## Requirement

Docker Compose file for ghost CMS, provided here. I prefer VS to attach to the container, but feel free to use any editor as long as you know how to connect to the different files


## Usage

A generic Docker compose file is provided, make sure to have both docker and docker compose installed. Navigate to a folder that you want to have your docker environment volume in and git clone this repository into it. If you need to use other mounted drives, change the docker compose file volume options to a dedicated directory. Docker compose up and connect your editor to instance.
